# C++ Personal Style Guide

A reference for my personal style of writing programs in C++.  
Despite being my go-to language for most tasks, I'll happily concede that C++ has no shortage of flaws and shortcomings, arising from both feature creep, and by virtue of being designed several decades before most other modern languages. The following is a list of language features that I do or do not employ in regular practice, with justification for each decision attached, listed by ISO revision.  
As a general guide, I usually work around C++11 and its associated idioms, and only selectively apply features from later revisions (whose overwhelming feature bloat and increasing _reliance_ on the C++ Standard Library do not come across as appealing).
